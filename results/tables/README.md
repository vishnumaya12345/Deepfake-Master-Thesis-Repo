\# Tables



This folder contains exported CSV tables with frame-level outputs from our experiments.



\- Frame-level tables: per-frame prediction scores/labels and correctness.



These CSVs cover the custom identity-swap datasets (Swap-1/5/10) for F3Net, FFD, and Xception. They were used as supporting material for additional error/risk inspection and for selecting representative misclassified-frame examples shown in the thesis (e.g., Fake→Real and Real→Fake example frames). The main evaluation and detector comparisons in the thesis are reported using AUC, AP, and EER in Chapter 5.
